## User Jounrey

A user is excited to plan a trip to New York with their friends, but quickly becomes overwhelmed when the group chat floods with conflicting messages. The user signs up for our group trip planning app, GroupGetaway, chooses to create a new trip. They fill in the details and add their friends to the planner. The user and their friends can edit their budgets and suggest new events. For every suggested events, the user and their friends vote on whether or not to keep it. Once the polls are in, the user takes majority vote and approves or disapproves the events. For events that have been approved, the user and their friends begin to divide up the costs. After a week of back-and-forth planning, the group has a finalized itinerary that fits everyoneâ€™s budget. Confident and stress-free, the group starts preparing for their upcoming trip, knowing they can open GroupGetaway anytime to stay on track.
